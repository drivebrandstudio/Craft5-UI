## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`CRAFT_CMS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`
`CRAFT_CMS_GRAPHQL_TOKEN`
`MY_SECRET_TOKEN`

## Deployment

RunCloud sets up webhooks into our github repos, so the deployment of changes should be done through that webhook. When you `git push` to main or merge a PR to main, the production site will auto-magically update.
